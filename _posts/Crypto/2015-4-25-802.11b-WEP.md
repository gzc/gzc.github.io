## Intro
<p id="part0"></p>

Below is the picture describing the algorithm for 802.11b WEP.
![pic](/assets/802.11b/1.png)

### Main points
- CRC(m) is the checksum of MESSAGE m, here it's not important so do not care.
- IV is 24-bits string, increasing by every frame from 0 and k is a 104-bits string so the total length is 128.
- PRG is a pseudorandom generator algorithm and the input is IV || k , || means concatenation.
- The receiver receive the ciphertext, plus a IV in front of ciphertext and apply the decoding algorithm.

----------------------------------

## BugI-limited IV
<p id="partI"></p>

### The limited 24-bits IV

802.11b WEP algorithm uses a 24-bit length IV, which means we have only 
$$2^{24} \approx {16million}$$ unique frame numbers. That means every 16million frames we will obtain the same keys,
under such condition we could apply a two-time pad attack.

----------------------------------

## BugII-Powercycle
<p id="partII"></p>

### Powercycle

Every powercycle IV will reset to 0. 

As a result, we could get a lot frames with IV set to 0.

Under such circumstances, we could also apply two-time pad attack.

----------------------------------

## BugIII-Related keys

###RC4
PRG in WEP use a algorithm called RC4

key for frame #1: (1||k)

key for frame #2: (2||k)

and so on. These keys are related, they are almost the same. And after processed by RC4, we could also find some relation.

###Attack
Fluhrer,Mantin ans Shamir in 2001 found that after 
$$10^6 frames \space you \space can \space recover \space the \space secret   \space key$$
Later others proposed better method shows
$$40000 frames \space are  \space sufficient$$
